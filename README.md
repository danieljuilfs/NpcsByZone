A collection of flask web projects made for shards of dalaya. 

NPCByZone
    Pulls data from the npc database to generate a list of every npc in a zone for easy editing. This was the first thing I wrote in python in like two years and boy did it show. But got it done!

SpawnGroups
    Allows users to view, create, and edit spawn groups from a simple web interface. We previously lacked this functionality from the web tools and people had to do this manually making it difficult for many users to create or edit their own spawn groups.
